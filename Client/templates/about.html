    <h3>Democracy and the Internet</h3>
    <p>
      Since the beginning of the Internet it has been heralded for its
      revolutionary democratic potential. We believe that this potential still
      exists but it may not last forever. Although civil society has been
      extraordinarily creative in using the Internet for positive social change
      we believe that it could lead more — and not always take its cues from
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although many approaches to communication can be found online,
      deliberation seems to be rarely supported. Unfortunately many online
      discussions seem to have no resolution or, worse degenerate into "flame
      wars" that make any cooperation impossible.
    </p>

    <h3>eLiberate</h3>
    <p>
      Motivated by a desire to help make online discussions more
      productive—particularly among civil society groups who are striving to
      create more "civic intelligence" in our society—we have been developing
      eLiberate, an online system that will allow people in different locations
      to come together virtually using the internet. We believe that
      face-to-face meetings are still very important but appropriate use of
      eLiberate can help organizations with limited resources. Our hope is that
      non-profit groups will use eLiberate to save time and money on travel and
      use the resources they save on other important activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      eLiberate is currently a text-based system. One of the advantages of this
      is that a transcript of the meeting is created almost as side-effect of
      having the meeting. The system employs a straightforward user interface
      which is educational as well as facilitative. The interface shows, for
      example, only the legal actions that are available to the users at that
      specific time in the meeting (a user, for example, isn't allowed to second
      a motion when there is no motion before the assembly that needs to be
      seconded).
    </p>

    <h3>Testing eLiberate</h3>
    <p>
      We at the Public Sphere Project are now beginning to work with groups who
      are interested in trying the system to support actual meetings. We are
      enthusiastic about the system but we are well aware that the system as it
      stands may have problems that need fixing. It is for that reason that we
      plan to host a small number of meetings over the next few months and
      gather feedback from attendees. Our current plan is to make eLiberate
      freely available for online meetings in the near future and to release the
      software under a free software license at some point in the
      not-too-distant future.
    </p>

    <h3>Using eLiberate</h3>
    <p>
      It is our intent to make eLiberate easy to use. eLiberate provides cues to
      permissible actions (and online help for all features is high on our
      things to do list). Using of eLiberate is intended to be educational; we
      believe that meeting attendees will become more knowledgeable about
      Roberts Rules and the use of eLiberate over time through normal use of the
      system. Having said that, however, it is still important to acknowledge
      that some knowledge of—and experience with—Roberts Rules is critical to
      successful participation in eLiberate meetings. Groups intending to use
      eLiberate should work to ensure that all meeting attendees have basic
      understanding of the various motions the basic rules. Additionally, the
      meeting chair should be prepared to assist attendees whenever possible. We
      also will strive to be available to assist even though this is primarily a
      volunteer activity. Finally, we are developing a users manual that will
      explain how the system works and give a brief introduction to Roberts
      Rules.

    <h3>A Few Words on Roberts Rules of Order</h3>
    <p>
      In his 1996 book New Community Networks Douglas Schuler proposed that
      Roberts Rules of Order could be used as a basis for online deliberation.
      Roberts Rules of Order was developed by Henry Robert in the late 1800s to
      describe an orderly process for people meeting together face-to-face to
      make decisions fairly. One of the most important guideline was that
      although every attendee would have opportunities to make his or her ideas
      heard, the minority could not prevent the majority from making decisions.
      Robert labored over the "rules" for 30 years and they are now in daily use
      by tens of thousands of deliberative bodies worldwide. One of the
      interesting things that we have learned about Roberts Rules is that the
      process seems to scale up: small groups of 5 or so can use this approach
      as can groups numbering in the hundreds.
    </p>

    <h3>A Little History</h3>
    <p>
      n 1999 a team of students at The Evergreen State College developed the
      first prototype of an online version of Roberts Rules of Order. This was
      later presented at the Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing
      symposium by John Adams and Matt Powell in 200l. In 2003 Evergreen student
      Nathan Clinton, working with Schuler, designed and implemented the first
      workable system. Clinton and Schuler named the system eLiberate, which
      rhymes with deliberate (the verb). The current version, also developed by
      Clinton, uses the Meteor framework and client-side processing to help
      ensure realtime updates for all attendees.
    </p>

    <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
    <p>
      There are other ways of helping this work in addition to using eLiberate
      and providing feedback. Most of the development so far has been done by
      volunteers. As we move forward we expect that our work load will increase
      —and our expenses will rise as well. In other words, your tax-deductible
      donations could help us work more effectively with future work. This
      future work includes developing the online help system that actually lets
      people know when and how to use the various "motions" in Roberts Rules;
      adding support for other deliberative protocols, including extensions and
      modifications to Roberts Rules; finishing the users manual; and designing
      other deliberative configurations (e.g. support for smart phone use).
